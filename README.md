# ST 558 Project 1

*Authors: Alana Pooler and Monica McDaniel*

### Project Goal

We’ll create generic functions to automatically summarize and plot certain returned data. Lastly, we’ll write
up a document via quarto (just like we did with the homework) to describe our thought process and give
examples of using the functions.
