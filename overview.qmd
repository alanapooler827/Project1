## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to write functions that will manipulate and process data sets that come from a census API. We have created generic functions to automatically summarize and plot certain returned data.

## Project Components

**Tibble helper function:**

-   Add info about to_tibble helper function
-   Add example usage

**Query Census API function:**

-   This function allows the user to query the PUMS API with their own inputs.

-   The user can change the year of survey, the numeric and categorical variables retrieved, and the geography level.

-   Example Usage:

    ``` r
    # Default Arguments
    query_pums(
      year = 2022,
      num_vars = c('AGEP', 'PWGTP'),
      cat_vars = 'SEX',
      geo_level = 'All',
      subset = NULL
    )
    ```

    *Note: it is not recommended to call query_pums() without sub-setting the geography level unless necessary. This will be time-consuming due to the size of the census data sets.*

    ``` r
    # Specifying a geography level and subset
    query_pums(
      geo_level = 'State',
      subset = '37'
    )

    # Specifying multiple geography levels
    query_pums(
      geo_level = 'Region',
      subset = c('1', '3')
    )
    ```
